There are now hundreds and thousands of applicants for a single job on LinkedIn for example. A few weeks ago I applied for a position with easy apply that had 5,288 applicants.</p> <p>Spam emails from tech companies searching for tech customers because they have no idea who their potential customers are. Blanket marketing campaigns searching far and wide.</p> <h3 id="some-of-the-questions-we-can-ask-ourselves">Some of the questions we can ask ourselves?</h3> <ul> <li> <p>How can job seekers narrow their search for jobs with their skills in industries or business verticals they would enjoy working in?</p> </li> <li> <p>Could a recruiter place a candidate at a company before the job posting was ever posted because they knew the company needed a certain skill set based on signals from the market and the company itself?</p> </li> <li> <p>How can tech marketing and sales departments research the trending technologies to design, build, and sell to.</p> </li> <li> <p>Companies that have a great product that would enhance the use of another tech product used by a potential customer, but who are they?</p> </li> <li> <p>Is there a place out there to do this research or at the very least a start-off point?</p> </li> </ul> <p>Theirstack.com is a company with the ambitious vision to store and catalog all the technologies used by all companies in the world into a technographic database. Every tech job description in the world contains valuable information that can be used for many purposes. This data is being mined from the Internet and put into one single data store to provide a valuable service to marketing, sales, recruiters, and job seekers. Theirstack is a viable service that can answer these questions.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Question: How does one even begin to find this information and then store it in a searchable way?</p> </li> <li> <p>Answer: A lot of scraping the internet of raw data and a lot of compute power running a carefully architected tech stack is needed. The global search and local data analysis to synthesize as precise and accurate a technographic database as possible is continuously improved upon using imperfect and missing information. It expensive when scraping thousands of websites and databases daily to build the world’s largest technographic database that is both historical (for research) and timely (for decision support)</p> </li> </ul> <hr/> <p>A short primer for those not familiar with the term tech stack:</p> <p>On Monday, June 30th at 1:47 PM Eastern Time, Microsoft Co-pilot described the IT Stack or Tech Stack as: “a collection of technologies, tools, programming languages, and software products used together to develop and run applications”.</p> <h3 id="the-tech-stack-can-typically-be-broken-down-into">The tech stack can typically be broken down into</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Front-end tech (i.e. the browser, javascript)</p> </li> <li> <p>Back-end tech (i.e. server side application)</p> </li> <li> <p>Database (i.e. an SQL database)</p> </li> <li> <p>Development tools (i.e. IDE – integrated Development environment)</p> </li> </ul> <p>Knowing all the technologies a company uses to deliver their services is actionable intelligence for Sales and Marketing Departments. Knowing what the tech stack is across companies, industries, and geography overtime is a gold mine of information to the right people.</p> <p>On the one hand companies want to share enough information in their job descriptions to allow job seekers to know if they should apply.</p> <p>On the other and they don’t want to reveal too much information to send signals to the wrong people.</p> <p>Hence the need for Theirstack.com to scrape basically every job publicly available on the internet without any active collaboration with the job posters. It then needs to be synthesized and presented in various ways to those clever enough to know the true value of such a data store.</p> <p>Theirstack.com’s tech stack works 24/7 to provide timely and relevant data. It can be consumed by direct search on their website, APIs, and other fancy methods. The fancy methods are where the real power can be harnessed by Sales and Marketing companies across all industries and business verticals to enhance their own business efforts.</p> <p>Some Metrics:</p> <ul> <li> <p>5300 technologies tagged and counting</p> </li> <li> <p>50 Million job postings and counting</p> </li> <li> <p>Data from 195 countries</p> </li> </ul> <p>How their data can be used is only open to the imagination of the sales, marketing, research, competitor analysis, job seekers, and career guidance counsellors.</p> <p>You might be asking: If I am a recruiter or company posting jobs, what is the one thing is I can do to help without giving away information which doth not be given away?</p> <p>Answer: Obviously adding more technologies used in the job description would be great, but we need to realistic. If you could add a unique alpha-numeric Record ID at the very top of every job description. Especially if you post the same job to multiple sites.</p> <p>Why a record ID and why at the very top? It saves compute time and storage which lowers costs for everyone. Ask a data engineer, they will totally geek out answering the question, be patient.</p> <p>While looking for employment and researching product management I stumbled upon theirstack.com and immediately was intrigued by the value proposition of how their service might help repair a broken job search and recruiting system. I encourage any one on both sides of the job hunting table to explore the website and gain insights into the value that with a little imagination can be found there.</p> <p>This would be off – label use of their service, per their vision, this data store can be used to find customers for products and services now that their tech stack is made visible. Would having a list of every company that uses a specific ERP, CRM, CMS, or development tool be helpful?</p> <p>One fun project I am working on is using n8n.io to create an automation that pulls from Theirstack.com to find every company using n8n and posting jobs that need this skill set. This automation can be used to load these job postings into a Discord Server channel focused on the professional development of n8n.io. Shout out to Ghost Coder’s Automation Huddle Discord Server as a potential place for this to reside.</p> <p>In a world of LLM where long form answers are now considered less than 100 words and short form less than 10, I hope my first article was informative.</p> <p>This article may pop up on other social media sites to expand reach.</p> <p>I truly hope I never use AI to ghost write my articles, here are some metrics:</p> <hr/> <h3 id="human-intelligence-metrics">Human Intelligence Metrics</h3> <ul class="task-list"> <li class="task-list-item"> <p><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked"/>Research: 3 hours</p> </li> <li class="task-list-item"> <p><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked"/>Writing &amp; Editing: 3 hours</p> </li> <li class="task-list-item"> <p><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked"/>Peer Review / Feedback Loop: 30 minutes</p> </li> <li class="task-list-item"> <p><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked"/>Total Work Time: 6 hours</p> </li> <li class="task-list-item"> <p><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked"/>First Ideation: June 19, 2025</p> </li> <li class="task-list-item"> <p><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked"/>Publication Date: July 19, 2025</p> </li> <li class="task-list-item"> <p><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked"/>Total Elapsed Time: 30 Days</p> </li> </ul>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="data"/><category term="technographic"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Technical and business analysis of theirstack.com]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Google Gemini updates: Flash 1.5, Gemma 2 and Project Astra</title><link href="https://chriskcovert.github.io/blog/2024/google-gemini-updates-flash-15-gemma-2-and-project-astra/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Google Gemini updates: Flash 1.5, Gemma 2 and Project Astra"/><published>2024-05-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://chriskcovert.github.io/blog/2024/google-gemini-updates-flash-15-gemma-2-and-project-astra</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://chriskcovert.github.io/blog/2024/google-gemini-updates-flash-15-gemma-2-and-project-astra/"><![CDATA[<p>May 14, 2024 We’re introducing a series of updates across the Gemini family of models, including the new 1.5 Flash, our lightweight model for speed and efficiency, and Project Astra, our vision for the future of AI assistants. In December, we launched our first natively multimodal model Gemini 1.0 in three sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. Just a few months later we released 1.5 Pro, with enhanced performance and a breakthrough long context window of 1 million tokens.Developers and enterprise customers have been putting 1.5 Pro to use in incredible ways and finding its long context window, multimodal reasoning capabilities and impressive overall performance incredibly useful.We know from user feedback that some applications need lower latency and a lower cost to serve. This inspired us to keep innovating, so today, we’re introducing Gemini 1.5 Flash: a model that’s lighter-weight than 1.5 Pro, and designed to be fast and efficient to serve at scale.Both 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash are available in public preview with a 1 million token context window in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. And now, 1.5 Pro is also available with a 2 million token context window via waitlist to developers using the API and to Google Cloud customers.We’re also introducing updates across the Gemini family of models, announcing our next generation of open models, Gemma 2, and sharing progress on the future of AI assistants, with Project Astra.Context lengths of leading foundation models compared with Gemini 1.5’s 2 million token capability1.5 Flash is the newest addition to the Gemini model family and the fastest Gemini model served in the API. It’s optimized for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale, is more cost-efficient to serve and features our breakthrough long context window.While it’s a lighter weight model than 1.5 Pro, it’s highly capable of multimodal reasoning across vast amounts of information and delivers impressive quality for its size.The new Gemini 1.5 Flash model is optimized for speed and efficiency, is highly capable of multimodal reasoning and features our breakthrough long context window.1.5 Flash excels at summarization, chat applications, image and video captioning, data extraction from long documents and tables, and more. This is because it’s been trained by 1.5 Pro through a process called “distillation,” where the most essential knowledge and skills from a larger model are transferred to a smaller, more efficient model.Read more about 1.5 Flash in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report, on the Gemini technology page, and learn about 1.5 Flash’s availability and pricing.Over the last few months, we’ve significantly improved 1.5 Pro, our best model for general performance across a wide range of tasks.Beyond extending its context window to 2 million tokens, we’ve enhanced its code generation, logical reasoning and planning, multi-turn conversation, and audio and image understanding through data and algorithmic advances. We see strong improvements on public and internal benchmarks for each of these tasks.1.5 Pro can now follow increasingly complex and nuanced instructions, including ones that specify product-level behavior involving role, format and style. We’ve improved control over the model’s responses for specific use cases, like crafting the persona and response style of a chat agent or automating workflows through multiple function calls. And we’ve enabled users to steer model behavior by setting system instructions.We added audio understanding in the Gemini API and Google AI Studio, so 1.5 Pro can now reason across image and audio for videos uploaded in Google AI Studio. And we’re now integrating 1.5 Pro into Google products, including Gemini Advanced and in Workspace apps.Read more about 1.5 Pro in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report and on the Gemini technology page.Gemini Nano is expanding beyond text-only inputs to include images as well. Starting with Pixel, applications using Gemini Nano with Multimodality will be able to understand the world the way people do — not just through text, but also through sight, sound and spoken language.Read more about Gemini 1.0 Nano on Android.Today, we’re also sharing a series of updates to Gemma, our family of open models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models.We’re announcing Gemma 2, our next generation of open models for responsible AI innovation. Gemma 2 has a new architecture designed for breakthrough performance and efficiency, and will be available in new sizes.The Gemma family is also expanding with PaliGemma, our first vision-language model inspired by PaLI-3. And we’ve upgraded our Responsible Generative AI Toolkit with LLM Comparator for evaluating the quality of model responses.Read more on the Developer blog.As part of Google DeepMind’s mission to build AI responsibly to benefit humanity, we’ve always wanted to develop universal AI agents that can be helpful in everyday life. That’s why today, we’re sharing our progress in building the future of AI assistants with Project Astra (advanced seeing and talking responsive agent).To be truly useful, an agent needs to understand and respond to the complex and dynamic world just like people do — and take in and remember what it sees and hears to understand context and take action. It also needs to be proactive, teachable and personal, so users can talk to it naturally and without lag or delay.While we’ve made incredible progress developing AI systems that can understand multimodal information, getting response time down to something conversational is a difficult engineering challenge. Over the past few years, we’ve been working to improve how our models perceive, reason and converse to make the pace and quality of interaction feel more natural.Building on Gemini, we’ve developed prototype agents that can process information faster by continuously encoding video frames, combining the video and speech input into a timeline of events, and caching this information for efficient recall.By leveraging our leading speech models, we also enhanced how they sound, giving the agents a wider range of intonations. These agents can better understand the context they’re being used in, and respond quickly, in conversation.With technology like this, it’s easy to envision a future where people could have an expert AI assistant by their side, through a phone or glasses. And some of these capabilities are coming to Google products, like the Gemini app and web experience, later this year.We’ve made incredible progress so far with our family of Gemini models, and we’re always striving to advance the state-of-the-art even further. By investing in a relentless production line of innovation, we’re able to explore new ideas at the frontier, while also unlocking the possibility of new and exciting Gemini use cases.Learn more about Gemini and its capabilities.

I am an IT project management / automation / software developer professional living in Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada. My professional interests are PMO, IT project management, cyber security, software development & implementation. 
Took a nearly 10 year hiatus from software development but am back at it again using various tools on personal projects. These tools are SQLite, SpatialLite Library, Kotlin, Excel VBA, N8N, Python, Cursor, Github, airtable, amoungst others. 
I am available for free lance fractional PMO and project management services for startups and solopreneurs. I am also passively looking for co-founders for my business initatives or those of others.
